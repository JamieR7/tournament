Feature: End‑of‑Tournament Celebration Screen Before Showing Final Table

Please keep the current logic for detecting when all games are finished and for computing the final standings. Now add a simple celebration step between “tournament finished” and “show final standings”.

1. Detect tournament completion (reuse existing check)
When every game in games[] has status === 'finished', the app should:

Stop the timer if it is still running.

Trigger an end‑of‑tournament state, e.g. tournamentComplete = true.

2. Celebration overlay
When tournamentComplete === true and before the final table is shown:

Display a full‑width overlay panel over the courts/fixtures area with:

Large text:

“Congratulations everybody!”

On the next line (smaller): “High‑five the other teams; we’ll see the final results soon.”

A big button: “Click here to reveal the final table”.

The rest of the page (courts, fixtures, standings) should be dimmed but still visible in the background.

3. Simple “fireworks” animation
On the celebration overlay, add a lightweight fireworks/confetti effect, for example:

CSS/JS confetti particles falling from the top, or

Simple expanding circles / bursts using CSS animations or canvas.

Requirements:

Animation should run smoothly for a few seconds in a loop while the overlay is visible.

It should not interfere with the underlying state (no timers, no extra game logic).

4. Reveal final results on click
When the user clicks “Click here to reveal the final table”:

Hide the celebration overlay and stop the fireworks animation.

Scroll (if needed) to the Final Standings section.

Show the final standings table (which you already compute) clearly—this table should only become visible at this moment.

If the user reloads after completion, it is acceptable for the final table to be shown directly, but during normal flow the overlay should appear first.

5. Keep everything else unchanged
Do not change how standings are calculated or how fixtures are displayed.

Only add:

The end‑of‑tournament detection hook.

The celebration overlay with message and confetti.

The “click to reveal final table” behaviour.
