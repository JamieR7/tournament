Add finish-time calculation + fix reset tournament confirmation

Please add finish-time functionality and fix the reset confirmation styling, while keeping all existing features working.

1. Fix "Reset Tournament" confirmation
Currently the reset uses an ugly browser confirm dialog. Change it to match the "Next Round" confirmation style:

When user clicks "Reset Tournament":

Show an in-page modal (same style as Next Round confirmation)

Message: "Reset tournament?"

Subtext: "This will clear all scores and return to setup."

Buttons: Cancel and Reset

Behaviour:

Cancel: close modal, do nothing

Reset: run the reset logic (clear state, return to setup screen)

Use the same modal component/styling as the Next Round confirmation (centered card, backdrop, not window.confirm).

2. New setup inputs for finish time
In the setup panel, add:

Start time:

Radio buttons: "Start now" (default) or "Custom start time"

If custom: HH:MM input (24-hour format)

Finish time:

HH:MM input (24-hour format, required)

Label: "Desired finish time"

Place these near the team count / format selectors.

3. Calculate game duration on tournament start
When the user starts the tournament:

Determine start and finish timestamps:

If "Start now": startTime = Date.now()

If custom: parse the HH:MM and create a timestamp for today (or tomorrow if time has passed)

Parse finish time the same way

Count total rounds based on the schedule:

The schedule is already built per format/team-count

Count how many rounds exist (each round = one timer cycle)

Calculate precise game duration:

js
totalSeconds = (finishTime - startTime) / 1000
roundCount = /* number of rounds in schedule */
gameDurationSeconds = totalSeconds / roundCount
Use this duration for the timer:

Do NOT round to whole minutes internally

Display as MM:SS

Use this exact duration for each round's countdown

4. Validation and warnings
Before starting:

If gameDurationSeconds < 120 (less than 2 minutes):

Show warning: "Games would be very short (X seconds). Consider a later finish time."

Still allow starting if user confirms

If finish time is before start time or finish time has already passed:

Show error: "Finish time must be after start time and in the future"

Do not allow starting

5. Display expected finish time during tournament
In the timer area:

Show a small line: "Expected finish: HH:MM"

Calculate this as:

js
expectedFinish = startTime + (roundCount × gameDurationSeconds × 1000)
Update this display if:

Tournament is paused (shift forward by pause duration)

Rounds are manually advanced early (recalculate based on remaining rounds)

6. Pause handling
When paused:

Track total paused duration

Update "Expected finish" to shift forward by that amount

When resumed, the finish time should reflect the delay

7. Keep manual override available (optional)
The existing "MINS" input can either:

Be hidden/grayed out when using finish-time mode, or

Show as read-only with a note: "(auto-calculated from finish time)"

For simplicity, it's fine to just auto-calculate and not show the manual MINS input.

8. Works for all formats
This must work correctly for:

4 teams Round Robin (3 rounds)

6 teams Round Robin (~8 rounds)

8 teams Round Robin (14 rounds)

8 teams Group Stage (9 rounds: 6 group + 3 finals)

The key is counting rounds accurately from the pre-built schedule.

9. Existing features unchanged
Auto-advance still works (uses the calculated game duration)

Manual Next Round still works

All scoring, standings, celebration logic unchanged

Timer sounds (beeps, buzzer) unchanged

Dark mode unchanged

Please implement:

Replace reset tournament browser confirm with styled in-page modal matching Next Round style

Start time and finish time inputs in setup

Auto-calculate game duration based on total available time ÷ number of rounds

Use precise duration (seconds) for timer, display as MM:SS

Show "Expected finish" during tournament that updates with pauses

Validation/warnings for very short games or invalid times

Works for all team counts and formats (4/6/8 teams, Round Robin/Group Stage)

Do not break any existing timer, scoring, or tournament flow
