Next iteration – "Next Round" confirmation + Format selector (Group Stage vs Round Robin)

Please add these features while keeping all existing logic intact for the current 8-team, 2-court, 2-group + finals format.

1. Confirmation dialog for manual "Next Round"
When the user manually clicks "Next Round", show an in-page confirmation:

Modal overlay asking:

"Advance to the next round?"

"Current games will be marked as finished."

Buttons: Cancel and Advance.

Behaviour:

Cancel: close modal, do nothing.

Advance: run normal Next Round logic.

Important:

Use a custom modal (same style as celebration/reset), not window.confirm.

Do not show this confirmation when auto-advance triggers at timer 0.

Only for manual button clicks.

2. Small visual polish
Make the "GROUP" badge on court cards more prominent (filled pill in orange-yellow).

In "Up next" section, use lighter/italic text to distinguish from current game.

3. Tournament Format selector
Add a Tournament Format choice at the top of the setup area (before the tournament starts):

Radio buttons or dropdown:

"Group Stage (2 groups of 4 + finals)" – default, what you have now.

"Full Round Robin (all teams play each other)" – new simpler format.

Behaviour for each format:
Format 1: Group Stage (existing)
Keep exactly as it is now:

8 teams split into Group A and Group B.

Group round-robin within each group.

Finals: semis (1A vs 2B, 1B vs 2A), placement games (3v3, 4v4), 3rd/4th playoff, final.

Group standings during group stage.

Final standings 1-8 after all games.

Format 2: Full Round Robin (new, simpler)
All 8 teams play each other once.

Total games: 28 (= 8×7/2).

Schedule into rounds using the same "no team twice per round" logic:

Each round has up to 2 games (one per court).

Build rounds greedily to avoid conflicts.

No groups, no finals, no semis.

Display:

Courts show current games as normal.

Fixtures table lists all 28 games with Round, Court, Team A, Score A, Team B, Score B.

One league table with all 8 teams:

Columns: Team, P, W, D, L, GF, GA, GD, Pts.

Sort by Points → GD → GF.

Final standings = same league table once all games finished (positions 1-8).

No celebration overlay needed or optional; just show "Tournament Complete – Final Standings" heading.

Implementation notes:
Keep both engines separate:

If format is "Group Stage", use existing scheduling/finals logic.

If format is "Full Round Robin", use a simpler pure round-robin scheduler with no finals.

The format choice must be made before starting the tournament; do not allow changing mid-tournament.

Timer, auto-advance, "Up next", score editing, and dark mode must work for both formats.

Please implement:

Manual "Next Round" confirmation modal.

Visual polish (GROUP badge, Up Next styling).

Format selector with two distinct tournament engines (Group Stage and Full Round Robin).

Do not break any existing behaviour; the Group Stage format should work exactly as it does now.
