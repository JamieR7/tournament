Next version – “Up next”, dark mode, and easier score edits

Please keep the existing 8‑team, 2‑court, 2‑group + finals structure, auto‑advance timer, standings, and celebration exactly as they are.

Now add only the following features.

1. Per‑court “Up Next” display
For each court card:

Maintain a court queue listing all game IDs for that court in order:

js
courtQueues[courtId] = [gameIdRound1, gameIdRound2, ...];
currentIndex[courtId] // index of the game currently on that court
On the court card, under the current matchup, add:

Label: “Up next”.

If courtQueues[courtId][currentIndex + 1] exists:

Show the next game’s teams: Team X vs Team Y.

If there is no further game on that court:

Show “No more games on this court”.

When rounds advance (manually or via auto‑advance):

Increment currentIndex[courtId] for each court that has a game in the new round.

Recompute “Up next” purely from courtQueues[courtId][currentIndex + 1].

Do not search through all games to find “next”; the queue + index must be the single source of truth to avoid conflicts.

2. Easier score editing in Fixtures (up/down arrows)
In the Fixtures table, make score adjustments quicker:

For every game row, for both Score A and Score B:

Keep the current score value.

Add two small buttons/icons next to each score: ▲ and ▼ (or + and –).

Behaviour:

▲ increments that team’s score by 1.

▼ decrements by 1, but never below 0.

On each click:

Update the corresponding game object in games[].

Immediately refresh:

Court displays (if that game is currently on a court).

Group standings.

Final standings (including final 1–8 table).

This must work for all games, including finished ones, so referees can correct past scores at any time.

3. Light/Dark mode toggle
Add a global theme toggle in the header:

A switch or button (e.g. “Light / Dark” or sun/moon icon).

Implement via body classes:

css
body.light { ... }  // current light theme
body.dark  { ... }  // new dark theme
Dark mode guidelines:

Dark navy background.

Light/off‑white text.

Keep the existing dark‑blue / red / orange‑yellow accents, but ensure good contrast on dark background (e.g., adjust shades if needed).

The toggle should:

Apply instantly (no page reload).

Affect all components: timer area, courts, fixtures, standings, celebration overlay.

Please implement only:

Per‑court “Up next” built from a court queue and index,

Up/down arrow controls for scores in the Fixtures table, and

Light/Dark mode toggle.

Do not alter any other scheduling, timer, or standings logic.
