Next iteration – variable team count (4/6/8), fixed 2 courts, conditional Group Stage option

Please extend the setup to allow different numbers of teams while keeping courts fixed at 2.

Do not change any existing tournament logic; just add flexibility at setup time.

1. Fixed courts, variable teams
At the top of the setup area:

Remove or hide any "Number of courts" selector.

Always use 2 courts internally.

Add a "Number of teams" dropdown or button group:

Options: 4, 6, or 8.

Default: 8.

2. Conditional tournament format choice
Show the Tournament Format selector only when it makes sense:

If user selects 4 teams or 6 teams:
Do not show a format choice.

Automatically use Full Round Robin:

4 teams: 6 games total (3 rounds of 2 games each).

6 teams: 15 games total (8 rounds, some with 1 game if odd).

Show one league table (all teams).

No groups, no finals.

If user selects 8 teams:
Show the Tournament Format selector with radio buttons:

"Full Round Robin" – all 8 teams play each other, 28 games, one league table.

"Group Stage (2 groups of 4 + finals)" – existing structure with groups A/B, semis, placement, final.

3. Scheduling adjustments per team count
For each combination:

4 teams, Round Robin (2 courts)
6 total games.

Schedule into rounds (no team twice per round):

Round 1: 2 games (courts 1 & 2).

Round 2: 2 games.

Round 3: 2 games.

One league table, 4 teams.

Final standings 1–4 based on points/GD.

6 teams, Round Robin (2 courts)
15 total games.

Schedule into rounds (max 2 games per round):

Some rounds will have 2 games, some will have 1 (when you can't avoid team conflicts).

One league table, 6 teams.

Final standings 1–6.

8 teams, Round Robin (2 courts)
28 total games (already working).

One league table, 8 teams.

Final standings 1–8.

8 teams, Group Stage (2 courts)
Keep exactly as now (already working).

2 groups of 4, group round-robins, then finals.

4. Dynamic team name inputs
When the user changes the team count:

Show exactly that many team name input fields (e.g., 4 fields for 4 teams).

Prefill with "Team 1", "Team 2", etc.

Allow user to rename them before starting.

5. All existing features must work
For any team count and format:

Timer with auto-advance.

Per-court "Up next".

Score editing (court +/– and fixtures table arrows).

Standings (group or league as appropriate).

Final standings (1–N where N = team count).

Dark mode.

Manual "Next Round" confirmation.

Celebration overlay (optional for round robin, required for group stage).

Please implement:

Fixed 2 courts (no choice).

Team count selector (4, 6, or 8).

Conditional format choice (only show for 8 teams).

Correct scheduling for all combinations.

Ensure all existing features (timer, scores, standings, etc.) adapt to the chosen setup.

Do not break the existing 8-team Group Stage or 8-team Round Robin flows; they should work exactly as before when selected.
