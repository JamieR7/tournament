Fix: Alternate court assignments in 8-team Group Stage

Currently in the 8-team Group Stage format, teams play all their games on the same court throughout the tournament. This needs to change so teams experience different courts.

Goal:
Keep the exact same match schedule (who plays who, and when) but rotate which court each game is played on so teams alternate between courts.

Implementation:
After building the rounds with games, when assigning games to specific courts:

Current behavior (problem):
js
// Round 1:
Game 1 (Team 1 vs Team 2) → Court 1
Game 2 (Team 5 vs Team 6) → Court 2

// Round 2:
Game 3 (Team 3 vs Team 4) → Court 1  // same pattern repeats
Game 4 (Team 7 vs Team 8) → Court 2
Result: Group A teams always play on Court 1, Group B teams always on Court 2.

New behavior (solution):
Use a round-based offset to rotate court assignments:

js
for (let roundIndex = 0; roundIndex < rounds.length; roundIndex++) {
  const gamesInRound = rounds[roundIndex];
  const courtOffset = roundIndex % courtCount; // rotates 0, 1, 0, 1, ... for 2 courts
  
  gamesInRound.forEach((game, gameIndex) => {
    const courtIndex = (gameIndex + courtOffset) % courtCount;
    const courtId = courtIndex + 1; // courts are 1-indexed
    game.courtId = courtId;
  });
}
Example with 2 courts:
Round 1 (offset = 0):

Game A → Court 1

Game B → Court 2

Round 2 (offset = 1):

Game C → Court 2 (shifted)

Game D → Court 1 (shifted)

Round 3 (offset = 0):

Game E → Court 1

Game F → Court 2

Round 4 (offset = 1):

Game G → Court 2

Game H → Court 1

Result:
Teams from both groups experience both courts

Match pairings and timing unchanged

Conflict-free scheduling still maintained

Court queues and "Up next" still work correctly

Apply to all formats:
This should work for:

8-team Group Stage (primary need)

8-team Round Robin

6-team and 4-team Round Robin

For any multi-court tournament, alternate the court assignments per round.

Please implement this court rotation while keeping all match scheduling, timing, scoring, and UI features unchanged.
